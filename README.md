# colorful-lines

My JS clone of the Colorful Lines game. This code was [written in 2010](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2010/02/24/a-simple-canvas-based-javascript-game-with-a-django-back-end), ported
over from an earlier Perl version I wrote [in 2003](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2003/05/30/perlines).

This game also known as "Color Lines" or
"Winlines" or "Winlinez"; I discovered it as
[glines](https://linux.die.net/man/6/glines) in
the GNOME distribution in the early 2000s. Based
on [this internet history website](https://www.goodolddays.net/game/id%2C1176/Color-Lines.html), it was originally designed by Olga Demina in 1992.
